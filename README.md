# workingwithtranscripts
code to work with transcriptions of conversations (mainly for psycholinguistics work)


# to use this code

You'll need to know your working path where the transcripts are kept (can be found by right-clicking folder and looking at properties)

# formatting + customization
For this code - all files are formatted as .txt files and have a name like "###_trans.txt". In the code, it is possible to change what the files are named when you're looking for them, but not the file type / extension. You'll have to code that in yourself :)

There are several places where I've noted in the comments where you can customize the code and it (hopefully) won't break. If it does, feel free to shoot me an email at my address (below).

# use of this code
